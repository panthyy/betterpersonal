  "description": "Globally distributed edge-based content management system and website builder based on React components (potentially framework/library agnostic). The system uses microVMs for server-side rendering and code execution, which allows for fast startup times reducing the latency of cold starts.  The goal of OnEdgeCMS is to allow users to create and deploy individual federated components, such as those found in a component library, with built-in  server-side logic. Taking inspiration from the game industry where level designers use assets built by 3D artists.",
