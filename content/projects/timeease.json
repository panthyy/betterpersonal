  "description": "A functional prototype for the KÃ¤vlinge municipality to explore the possibility of digitizing the attendance control of people performing rehabilitation work at a company in the municipality. The digital solution also aimed to help increase participation and provide better insight into the compensation given. To achieve this, we have developed a website where the people involved in the program can log in and confirm their attendance at the scheduled work shift. There is also information that should make it clear how much compensation they have earned and should feel motivating.",
